# koa-restify-mongoose

Easily create a flexible REST interface for mongoose models in KOA.

This is the first REST interface with restify and mongoose made for KOA. It's a fork from the original module [express-restify-mongoose/](https://florianholzapfel.github.io/express-restify-mongoose/)

Note: This module started with version 3.0.1 of the express repository. So, just to keep both versions number aligned, this module will start with the same version.

## Getting started

> The library is only compatible with mongoose >= 4

```sh
npm install koa-restify-mongoose --save
```

## Documentation

The documentation is the same than in [https://florianholzapfel.github.io/express-restify-mongoose/](https://florianholzapfel.github.io/express-restify-mongoose/).

All functionality is supported except for the postMiddleware function (feel free to fix it if you want)
